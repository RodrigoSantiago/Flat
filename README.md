## Overview
NetronFlat *is going to be* a library for material design UI development. It also provides simple and indispensable set of tools for working with xml, themes and images  

The main purpose is to work similar to the "Activities" system with the ability to handle different screen sizes, but with simplicity and efficiency. On the other hand, the files in xml are built in order to prioritize the reading. (No imports inside the xml, to avoid reflection)
